I didn\u0027t fully understand the idea  before, and I though we would have to explicitly disable RO option for every VM started.\n\nIn patch set 3 when vhost controller has \"ReadOnly yes\" I also have to manually specify RO flag.\nIn patch set 2 - I do not need to add \"f_readonly\" option explicitly, and this is fine. Disk in VM is visible as RO\u003d1.",
